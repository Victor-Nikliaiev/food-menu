# Food menu

React app with using such a hook as useState and was applied conditional rendering.

Also was used SCSS(grid and flexbox).
An important aspect is: that all buttons and filtered materials are generating automatically, on the fly, according to API data changing.
Great thanks to John Smilga and creators of Dark Reader add-on for inspiring me!

Live version of the app is on: [Here](https://food-menu-sandy.vercel.app/)
